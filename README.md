# Core-Course-Project
The problem is that motors usually break down without warning. This not only interrupts production but also increases repair costs. Traditional maintenance is either too late (after failure) or too costly (frequent manual checking). Our project solves this by predicting motor failure in advance using sensors and IoT.
